The Story, Event, Character, Scene and Idea tables will have full CRUD functionality.

## Additional Technologies


## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- User authentication
- Link a pinterest board to a character for visual inspiration
- Add a story to your notebook + add info/characters unique to that story.
- Utilize a timeline to track the events of your plot

#### PostMVP  

- Search functionality to find notes by linked char/scene
- All 4 media sizes
- Connect plot points with scenes/notes
